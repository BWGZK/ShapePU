# Datasets
1. The MSCMR dataset with mask annotations can be downloaded from [MSCMRseg](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/0/mscmrseg19/data.html).
2. Our scribble annotations of MSCMRseg have been released in [MSCMR_scribbles](https://github.com/BWGZK/CycleMix/tree/main/MSCMR_scribbles).
3. The scribble-annotated MSCMR dataset used for training could be directly downloaded from [MSCMR_dataset](https://github.com/BWGZK/CycleMix/tree/main/MSCMR_dataset). 
4. The ACDC dataset with mask annotations can be downloaded from [ACDC](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/) and the scribble annotations could be downloaded from [ACDC scribbles](https://vios-s.github.io/multiscale-adversarial-attention-gates/data). Please organize the dataset as the following structure:
```
XXX_dataset/
  -- TestSet/
      --images/
      --labels/
  -- train/
      --images/
      --labels/
  -- val/
      --images/
      --labels/
```

# Usage
1. Set the "dataset" parameter in main.py, line 55, to the name of dataset, i.e., "MSCMR_dataset".
2. Set the "output_dir" in main.py, line 57, as the path to save the checkpoints. 
3. Download the dataset, for example, the [MSCMR_dataset](https://github.com/BWGZK/CycleMix/tree/main/MSCMR_dataset). Then, Set the dataset path in /data/mscmr.py, line 110, to your data path where the dataset is located in.
4. Check your GPU devices and modify the "GPU_ids" parameter in main.py, line 61.
Start training with:
```
python main.py
```
